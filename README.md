# Instagram-User-Analytics
Instagram User analysis involves tracking how users engage with a digital product, such as a software application or a mobile app. The insights derived from this analysis can be used by various teams within the business. For example, the marketing team might use these insights to launch a new campaign, the product team might use them to decide on new features to build, and the development team might use them to improve the overall user experience. In this project, I used SQL and MySQL Workbench to analyze Instagram user data and answer questions posed by the management team. My insights will help the product manager and the rest of the team make informed decisions about the future direction of the Instagram app. The goal of this project is to use SQL skills to extract meaningful insights from the data. My findings could potentially influence the future development of one of the world's most popular social media platforms. The project "Instagram User Analytics" is an extensive data analysis initiative aimed at extracting meaningful insights from an Instagram-like database for the purposes of marketing strategy, user engagement, investor relations, and overall platform health. This project provided critical data-driven findings that could help in decision-making processes across multiple strategic areas including user retention, campaign planning, user authenticity verification, and more.

The project involved using structured query language (SQL) to analyze a relational database with tables containing information about users, photos, likes, and tags. Key focus areas included:

Loyal User Reward Program: Identifying the oldest users on the platform to potentially reward loyalty.
Inactive User Engagement: Finding users who never posted to re-engage them through promotional emails.
Contest Management: Determining the user with the most likes on a single photo to declare a contest winner.
Hashtag Research: Analyzing the most commonly used hashtags for strategic brand collaborations.
Ad Campaign Launch Timing: Discovering the most popular day of user registration to optimize ad campaign launches.
User Engagement Metrics for Investors: Calculating the average number of posts per user to provide an understanding of overall platform activity.
Detection of Bot and Fake Accounts: Identifying users who liked every post, which could indicate non-human behavior.
